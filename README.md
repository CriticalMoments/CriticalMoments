# CriticalMoments

## üèóÔ∏è Coming Soon üèóÔ∏è

This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for use.

## Get Started üöÄ

Read our [developer guide](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/quick-start) for integrating Critical Moments into your app.

## What is Critical Moments?

Critical moments is an if "this" then "that" system for mobile apps. You can install our SDK for iOS, then unlock a powerful set of tools to help grow your business, speed up development, and increase user satisfaction.

### "This" Triggers

A number of triggers can kick off an action:

* [Events](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/events/event-overview): trigger an action when a user performs an action, or a built-in actions occur (like app\_start)
* [Conditions](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/conditional-targeting/intro-to-conditions): build powerful conditional statements that can evaluate over 100 realtime device states, custom properties, functions and more. For example: `!dark_mode && (device_brightness < 0.1 || hour_of_day > 21)` could be a trigger for promoting your new "dark mode" feature.
* Powerful combinations: combine events, realtime conditions, and even past device state history to build advanced targeting for when actions fire.

### "That" Actions

When a condition is met, you can perform a wide array of actions:

* Ask users to subscribe or buy: firing your upsell prompts at the right moment can have a 72% increase on conversion rate, while reducing alert fatigue and user distraction
* Ask users to rate your app when they are most likely to give you a great review: after a positive interaction, and while they aren't distrated.
* Launch [actions built into our SDK](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/actions/actions-overview) like announcement banners,  modal popovers, alerts, web link, deep links, and more.
* Enable or disable [feature flags](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/feature-flags/conditional-feature-flags) to control any aspect of your app. Rollout features over time, or even fix bugs after they ship.
* Custom actions: link into actions in your codebase

For details on all the actions available, see the [actions overview](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/actions/actions-overview).

### Update anytime from the cloud

Connecting "this" to "that" is done via a cloud based [configuration file](https://docs.criticalmoments.io/config-file). You can update the config any time, without needing an app store update. Shipping updates any time unlocks powerful set of use cases:

* AB test your targeting for important optimizations like when you ask users to make a purchase or rate your app
* Fix bugs after they ship with conditional feature flags
* Let users know they should update their app (for old builds, or major bugs)
* Targeted user messaging: sending a message to the right user, and the right moment, including in builds that have shipped to app store long ago.
* Diffuse outages, by letting users know you're on it, and when you'll be back online

### Privacy Built In

While Critical Moments gives you an deep array of data to target users and optimize, the data never leaves the user's device. Conditional statements are evaluated locally.&#x20;

With Critical Moments, powerful targeting and optimization doesn't have to mean compromizing user privacy.
