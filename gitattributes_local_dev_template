# Git LFS config
# This is needed if you want to add snapshot test results, or run snapshot tests.
# Copy it to your local .git/info/attributes file to add/remove test snapshots from git.
# Not included in a in-repo .gitattributes file because it interferes with SPM install
# as xcode doesn't have lfs installed.
